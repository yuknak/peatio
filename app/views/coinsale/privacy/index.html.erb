<ol>
</ol>

<p>We may collect two types of data and information from our Users.</p>

<p>The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to you, which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services (&quot;<strong>Non-personal Information</strong>&quot;). We are not aware of the identity from which the Non-personal Information is collected. Non-personal Information which is collected may include your aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information about your device (e.g., the device you use, the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the website&#39;s domain name from which you linked to the Services, etc.), in order to enhance the functionality of the Services. We may also collect information about your activity on the Services (e.g., clicks, actions, online browsing, etc.).</p>

<p>The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (&quot;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&quot;). Such information may include:</p>

<ul>

For instance, when you share additional information about yourself through your use of the Services. We may also collect the feedback, suggestions, complaints and reports which you send to us. Please note that we may also collect complaints about you from other Users, which may include your Personal Information.</li>
	<li><strong>Communication Information</strong>: We may collect information from your communications with us.
