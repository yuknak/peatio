<h2>16. Lack of Financial Regulation</h2>

<h2>17. Know-Your-Client (&quot;KYC&quot;), Anti-money Laundering (&ldquo;AML&rdquo;) and Counter Terrorist Financing (&ldquo;CTF&rdquo;) Procedures</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">17.1. As part of our commitment to combat financial crimes, we have implemented procedures and systems aimed at allowing us to identify and mitigate the risks our Site and Services being misused for &nbsp;illegal purposes. These include our KYC, AML and CTF procedures, which are based on our collection of information about our Users, the assessment of AML/CTF risks associated with their activities, and the ongoing monitoring of transactions made by them.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">17.2. Where we have any suspicion that our business relationship with you, or a specific transaction which you wish to make, involve any risk of money laundering, terrorism financing or any other financial crime or &nbsp;prohibited activity, we may, at our sole discretion, refuse to accept you as a client, terminate any engagement with you, refuse to process any transaction, and take any other action we deem necessary, including reporting our suspicion to the competent legal authorities. We will not be obligated to inform you of any such action we choose to take, nor to provide you any explanation of our reasons for taking them or for our suspicions.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">17.3. For the purpose of conducting the abovementioned checks, we &nbsp;may collect certain personal information about you, either from you or from external sources.

<h2>18. Risks</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">18.1. The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies, involves significant risks. Prices can fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any currency, virtual or not, may be subject to large or sudden shifts in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market. You should be aware that the risk of loss in trading or holding Digital Currencies can be substantial.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">18.2. Digital Currency trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Digital Currency is a unique kind of currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank or government regulator that can take corrective measures to protect the value of the Digital Currency in a crisis, issue more currency, or balance the price fluctuations.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">18.3. Instead, Digital Currency is an autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals. Traders and market participants put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Thus, the value of Digital Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Fiat Currency for Digital Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Currency should the market for that Digital Currency disappear.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">18.4. Digital Currency trading may be susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse relative to demand and supply. For example, confidence in Digital Currency might collapse as a result of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems, for example, if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent transactions from settling.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">18.5. Transactions in the Digital Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">18.6. Due to the nature of Digital Currency, any technological difficulties experienced by the Company could prevent the access or use of a Member&rsquo;s Digital Currency.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">18.7. The abovementioned is not a closed list, there may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use. You should carefully assess whether your financial standing and tolerance for risk are suitable for buying, selling or trading Digital Currency.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">18.8. The Company uses banking providers in order to receive your funds and to make payments. Our banking providers do not transfer Digital Currency, exchange Digital Currency, or provide any services in connection with Digital Currency.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">18.9. Markets for Digital Currency have varying degrees of liquidity. Some are quite liquid while others may be thinner or illiquid. The Company does not guarantee&nbsp;any profit from trading or any other activity associated with the site.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">18.10. IN LIGHT OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED RISKS, WHICH ARE NOT A COMPREHENSIVE LIST, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER IF HOLDING DIGITAL CURRENCY IS SUITABLE FOR YOU DEPENDING ON YOUR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>

<h2>19. Customer Service</h2>
